# Project title and description
Git hub profile finder, data pulled from Github API using async/await. Built as a project as part of "Modern javaScript from the beginning" course.
## Motivation
Asynchronous JS and API practice was my main motivation here, wanted to undestand concepts of async/await better and have more fun with accessing APIs.
## Build status
Project is finished and that's the final version.
## Tech/framework used
Ui built with bootstrap, HTML and vanilla JS only, and Github API. API has a limit of 60 requests / hour as I didn't really bothered to authorize it.
## How to use
Intup Github users name in the search field, app will display profile picture, number of repos and other data pulled from the API.
